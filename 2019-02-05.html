      <hr>
      <p>It's been a day, but since I just updated the homepage and linked a (nonexistant) first page, 
          I really want to push the first post to match it for sake of completeness.</p>
      <p>I suppose that with nothing else on the site yet, it makes sense to talk about me for a 
          minute. I don't like going on about myself so I'll just stick to the facts. </p>
      <p>So right now, today, I am a systems engineer professionally, and privately software development
          has consumed all my other hobbies for the last 2-3 months. It seems like it's here to stay
          this time, and I couldn't be happier about it. I attribute that largely to discovering an
          affinity for working with Python.</p>
      <p>My very first full-on programming experience was with Java in an intermediate object-oriented course
          I took in college. Saying nothing of the language itself, (okay just one - verbosity matters) it's hard
          to support a language <a target="newtab" href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-case-that-never-ends-oracle-wins-latest-round-vs-google/">
          acquired by oracle and then used to sue Google all the way to the supreme court</a>, threatening a
          change in legal precedent which could fundamentally change how developers (and, by extenstion, users) work.</p>
