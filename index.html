    <p>There's not enough stuff out there on the internet! Quick! Make a website!</p>

    <h2>Purpose?</h2>
    <p> I've been brushing up on my dev skills, at this point I'm basically at the skill level as when I left college - having just 
        finished CS401. Instead of Java I'll focus on Javascript this time - go down the Web Dev path. 
        So far I've made good daily commits between a repl.it page, github gists, and a few archive pushes to github.
        From this day forward I'm going to write enough code to make at least 1 meaningful commit each and every day, 
        and push myself, no matter what.</p>

    <p> As far as structure goes... at this point it's looking like I should focus on Jquery first, move on to React for frontend,
        wind up doing Node.js and Mongo / others for backend stuff. 
    </p>

    <h2>Continued...</h2>
    <p> Over time I'll make this pretty. Maybe I'll even do one of those 'journey-to-dev' blogs that seem popular. Publish it someplace. Who knows.</p>
    <p> What I do know is I have an hour, and I need something to put up there today so some basic HTML and a little CSS can't hurt.
        Start with the basics and see where the project takes us...</p>
