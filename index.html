      <p>aka the 'Yet Another Personal Website' project</p>
      <p>let's get right into it then</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Welcome one and all</h2>
      <p>Hope you enjoy your visit. I'm creating this so I have a convenient place to write about things that
        interest me, or simply come across in day to day life - hence the name. </p>
      <p>Sometimes it feels more appropriate to write about something rather than just bookmark it as a note-to-self that
        'XYZ cool thing exists. Isn't that neat?'</p>
      <p>Similarly, there are many times I'm working through a problem and find the process of scrawling 
        train-of-consciousness notes therapeutic. Often I will go back and refine them down to pretty
        consise snippets, and it seems a shame not to share some of those daily successes and frustrations.</p>
      <p>So hop on over to a link, if you like start right at the <a href="2019-02-05.html">beginning</a>.</p>
